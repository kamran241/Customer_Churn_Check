# Customer Churn Prediction Project

This repository hosts a machine learning model for predicting customer churn, integrated with a web application. The project leverages **scikit-learn** for model training, **pandas** and **numpy** for data processing, **joblib** for model persistence, **Flask** for a prediction API, and **Streamlit** for an interactive user interface, Enabling user to input cvc file and view churn prediction and download that prediction file.

## Purpose

The goal is to provide a complete, deployable system for training, serving, and interacting with a customer churn prediction model via a web app. This `README` details the dependencies, setup, and instructions to run the project locally or in production.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- **Git** installed for cloning the repository.
- A code editor (e.g., VS Code) for modifying files like `app.py`.
- Basic familiarity with Python and terminal commands.

## Requirements

### Python Version
- **Python 3.13.3**: Primary environment for this project. If compatibility issues occur, Python 3.10 is recommended.

### Dependencies
The following packages are required:

| Package        | Version | Purpose                                      |
|----------------|---------|----------------------------------------------|
| Flask         | 3.0.3   | Backend API to serve model predictions       |
| pandas        | 2.2.2   | Data loading and preprocessing               |
| numpy         | 1.26.4  | Numerical operations for data and models     |
| scikit-learn  | 1.5.1   | Model training and evaluation                |
| joblib        | 1.4.2   | Saving and loading trained models            |
| streamlit     | 1.37.1  | Interactive web interface for users          |
| Werkzeug      | 3.0.3   | Flask dependency for request handling        |


All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/kamran241/Customer_Churn_Check.git  # this will clone the code from gihub 
      cd Customer_Churn_Check  ## this will be used to go to customer_churn_chek directory 

3. **Install Python 3.13.3**
    Download from python.org
       Verify installation:

   ```bash
      python --version  ## this will show you the version of python

5. **Install Dependencies**
    Install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt # this will install all the requirment

7. **Update Base Directory**

     Open app.py in a text editor.
     Change the base directory path from "C:\Users\kamra\OneDrive\Desktop\churn model" to your local project directory (e.g., /home/user/Customer_Churn_Check or C:\path\to\your\project).

8. **Verify Package Versions**
   Confirm versions match

   ```bash
   pip list | grep -E "Flask|pandas|numpy|scikit-learn|joblib|streamlit|Werkzeug|python-dotenv|gunicorn"

## How to Run

Once set up, run the application as follows:

1. Start the Flask server:

   ```bash
   python app.py # TO run the flask server

3. Run the Streamlit App:
      Launch the Streamlit interface:

   ```bash
   streamlit run frontend.py  ## this will run your ui

## Testing

1. API:
    Use test_data.csv with curl or Postman (see Test Data section).
2. UI:
    Upload test_data.csv in Streamlit or input data manually.

## Test Data
  To test the model, a sample of dataset (test_data.csv) are provided in the repository.
     Download: Find test data from the repo and download it and in **ui** give that data it will give you predictions.

# Troubleshooting

**Installation Errors:**
   
    
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade pip  # this will upgrade or install the pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt ## this will install your requirments

**Version Mismatches:**
  
      ```bash   
      pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall ## use this command to forcely install 

**Directory Issues:**
   Update app.pyâ€™s directory path correctly.
